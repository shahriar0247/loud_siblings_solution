# loud_siblings_solution


Plays an audio (i made it "Shut up Iftee") when there is audio above a certain thershold from his mic.

Used for people who have loud siblings on discord calls. if they shout "IMPOSTER" on among us. just send the 1.py file to your siblings computer, tell them to shout, look at the thresold. use that theresold in the python program (variable max-value if statement part) then record your own audio named output.wav and use it.

you probobly need python executable with -F -w on pyinstaller and start it on startup in your sublings computer
